                <p>
                    I'm a passionate full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience building web applications
                    that prioritize user experience and accessibility. My journey into tech started with a curiosity
                    about how websites work, which quickly evolved into a deep love for creating digital experiences
                    that make a difference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring nature with my camera, getting lost in science fiction
                    novels, or strumming my guitar. I believe that diverse experiences outside of work make us better
                    developers and more empathetic problem solvers.

                    Like many developers, I sometimes struggle with imposter syndrome. I'm actively working on:

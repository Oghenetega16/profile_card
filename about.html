            <p>
                I'm a passionate frontend developer with over 2+ years of experience building web applications
                that prioritize user experience and accessibility. My journey into tech started with a curiosity
                about how websites work, which quickly evolved into a deep love for creating digital experiences
                that make a difference.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring nature with my camera, getting lost in science fiction
                novels, or strumming my guitar. I believe that diverse experiences outside of work make us better
                developers and more empathetic problem solvers.

                of every learning opportunity.
